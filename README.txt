Assignment Description:
Implement Kruskal’s algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph, and evaluate its running time performance on a set of graph instances. 
Two multigraphs instances are included as sample input. 
Task I: find the cost of MST given a graph file.
Task II: Update the cost of MST given new edges to be added to the graph.
The objective is to minimize computation and efficiently re-compute the cost of the MST.


How to run the code: 
run the runTest.sh file in terminal, the output files can be found in results folder
The .py file is under src directory.
Input graphs are under data directory
Outputs are under results directory
